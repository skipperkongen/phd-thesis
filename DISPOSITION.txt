Marcos ambitious idea, three parts:
- (I) Introduction: talk about the two chapters that follow. 
- (P1) Pt 1: bulk: declarative cartography, about PRODUCING maps
- (P2) Pt 2: about SERVING digital maps
- Similar structure for both: state of the art, my contributions (advancing the state of the art).  

What-goes-where:
- I <- Case Study, P1 enables P2, Mention where related work is (which parts/chapters)
- P1 <- 
	Survey generalization, 
	CVL1 (closing the gap, part a), 
	CVL2 (closing the gap, part b)
- P2 <- 
	Survey on serving maps, getting to keyed data for maps, all this stuff you can use 
		incl. vectile (step 2),
		caching,
		prediction,
		data partitioning (step 3), 
		replication (step 4), 
		consistency, 
		key-value stores, 
		classic web serving infrastructures,
		papers from seminar
	Gap between state of the art, and the agency
	TileHeat (closing the gap, step 1), deploying a caching infrastructure
	
Publication strategy:

CVL2 (it's a journal thing, not a conference submission):
Approach: "Make CVL more general (star approach), with comparable performance"
- GeoInformatica (extended version of CVL), "completeness/thoroughness": repeat experiments, show new use cases (comp. to CVL), illustrate CVL2 with the new use cases 
- Only conference if "technical fun" or "something new" in compiler, real tech. take-away
