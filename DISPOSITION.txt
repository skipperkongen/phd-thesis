Marcos ambitious idea, three parts:
- (I) Introduction: talk about the two chapters that follow.
- (P1) Pt 1: bulk: declarative cartography, about PRODUCING maps
- (P2) Pt 2: about SERVING digital maps
- Similar structure for both: state of the art, my contributions (advancing the state of the art).  

What-goes-where:
- I <- Case Study, P1 enables P2
- P1 <- 
	Survey generalization, 
	CVL1 (closing the gap, part a), 
	CVL2 (closing the gap, part b)
- P2 <- 
	Survey on serving maps, getting to keyed data for maps, all this stuff you can use 
		incl. vectile (step 2), 
		data partitioning (step 3), 
		replication (step 4), 
		consistency, 
		key-value stores, 
		classic web serving infrastructures, 
		papers from seminar
	Gap between state of the art, and the agency
	TileHeat (closing the gap, step 1), deploying a caching infrastructure
