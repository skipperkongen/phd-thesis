\maketitle
\part*{Introduction}

\chapter{Multiscale Geographical Maps}
% section
Illustrate importance of multiscale visualization via reference to information cartography, data cube visualization, evolutionary timelines, social network visualizations and digital maps.

% section
\section{General Principles}
Mention Weibel definition (salience etc). Reference woodruff and toepfer (constant information density). Reference da sarma (zoom consistency and visibility constraint). Reference samet (proximity constraint). Reference someone for topological constraints.
% section
\section{Multiscale Abstraction}

Define difference between data- and visual abstraction, reference data cube paper. Reuse points and figures from ICDE 2014 presentation (what to display versus how to display). Mention the geographical terms of model generalization and cartographic generalization (reference Gruenreich). Mention that data abstraction for maps is surveyed in Part I chapter 1.

\section{Case Study: Danish Geodata Agency}
Mention GST and their use cases (POI and place names).

\part{Creating Multiscale Maps}

\chapter{Survey of Data Abstraction for Maps}
Reference Weibel and Harrie (constraint-based approach and salience). Reference Wollf (land use IP). Reference Da Sarma (fusion tables IP).

\part{Serving Multiscale Maps}


Marcos ambitious idea, three parts:
- (I) Introduction: talk about the two chapters that follow. 
- (P1) Pt 1: bulk: declarative cartography, about PRODUCING maps
- (P2) Pt 2: about SERVING digital maps
- Similar structure for both: state of the art, my contributions (advancing the state of the art).  

What-goes-where:
- I <- Case Study, P1 enables P2, Mention where related work is (which parts/chapters)
- P1 <- 
        Survey generalization, 
        CVL1 (closing the gap, part a), 
        CVL2 (closing the gap, part b)
- P2 <- 
        Survey on serving maps, getting to keyed data for maps, all this stuff you can use 
                incl. vectile (step 2),
                caching,
                prediction,
                data partitioning (step 3), 
                replication (step 4), 
                consistency, 
                key-value stores, 
                classic web serving infrastructures,
                papers from seminar
        Gap between state of the art, and the agency
        TileHeat (closing the gap, step 1), deploying a caching infrastructure
        
Publication strategy:

CVL2 (it's a journal thing, not a conference submission):
Approach: "Make CVL more general (star approach), with comparable performance"
- GeoInformatica (extended version of CVL), "completeness/thoroughness": repeat experiments, show new use cases (comp. to CVL), illustrate CVL2 with the new use cases 
- Only conference if "technical fun" or "something new" in compiler, real tech. take-away
