\section{Motivation}
% Opportunities for users
\emph{Pannable} and \emph{zoomable} geographical maps are important because they allows users to explore large repositories of information at different focal points and levels of abstraction. Furthermore, \emph{web-based} maps enable online users world-wide to gain spatial insights and make spatial decisions on the go. For example, journalists can enrich online articles with digital maps that yield spatial insights into the complex geographical realities of news stories (e.g. stories about wars, travel or pollution). As another example, tourists can use digital maps and location based services (LBS) to support localized decision making, e.g. finding near-by restaurants, shops or points of interest. Finally, real-estate agents can advertise new deals on geographical maps, which is of great interest to people looking to buy or sell homes in a particular area. % work with the examples

% Challenge 1: too many users
Today, consumers of maps have the opportunity to engage zoomable web maps anytime and anywhere, due in part to advances in mobile technology and a state of near-ubiquitous web access. As a consequence, web-based maps have attracted millions of users who bombard the end-points of spatial data services with a crushing request workload around the clock -- especially during peak hours. TODO: Explain the challenges presented to system engineers further... and give some examples.

% Challenge 2: big data
Everyday, a mass of data is accumulating online, which includes vast amounts of spatial data~\cite{agrawal2012bigdata}. The tendencies of this so-called Big Data are described by the ``three Vs'': \emph{volume}, \emph{variety}, and \emph{velocity}. While the need to visualize much of this data on maps is clear, it is very challenging to do so. Map producers must carefully execute the dual processes of \emph{data abstraction} (e.g. data selection and aggregation)~\cite{haunert2006landcover,schmid2013opensciencemap} and \emph{visual abstraction} (e.g. graphical expression)~\cite{jacques1967semiologie} in order to derive a useful map~\cite{stolte2003multiscale,weibel1999generalising}. These processes are made much harder in the context of Big Data. Furthermore, these tasks generally involve either preprocessing~\cite{sarma2012fusiontables,kefaloukos2014declarative} or indexing~\cite{bereuter2013real,nutanong2012multiresolution} of the data, which also becomes harder for Big Data. TODO: Give some examples

Marcos ambitious idea, three parts:
- (I) Introduction: talk about the two chapters that follow. 
- (P1) Pt 1: bulk: declarative cartography, about PRODUCING maps
- (P2) Pt 2: about SERVING digital maps
- Similar structure for both: state of the art, my contributions (advancing the state of the art).  

What-goes-where:
- I <- Case Study, P1 enables P2, Mention where related work is (which parts/chapters)
- P1 <- 
        Survey generalization, 
        CVL1 (closing the gap, part a), 
        CVL2 (closing the gap, part b)
- P2 <- 
        Survey on serving maps, getting to keyed data for maps, all this stuff you can use 
                incl. vectile (step 2),
                caching,
                prediction,
                data partitioning (step 3), 
                replication (step 4), 
                consistency, 
                key-value stores, 
                classic web serving infrastructures,
                papers from seminar
        Gap between state of the art, and the agency
        TileHeat (closing the gap, step 1), deploying a caching infrastructure
        
Publication strategy:

CVL2 (it's a journal thing, not a conference submission):
Approach: "Make CVL more general (star approach), with comparable performance"
- GeoInformatica (extended version of CVL), "completeness/thoroughness": repeat experiments, show new use cases (comp. to CVL), illustrate CVL2 with the new use cases 
- Only conference if "technical fun" or "something new" in compiler, real tech. take-away
