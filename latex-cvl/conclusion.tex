\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we present a novel declarative approach to the data reduction problem in map generalization. 
%The proposed approach is complete in the sense that it integrates seamlessly with existing database and cartographic generalization technology. 
The proposed approach integrates seamlessly with existing database technology, and allows users to specify, using the proposed CVL language, and across all scales, what goals and constraints the generated map should fulfill --- leaving the detailed \hl{selection} decisions to the system. The system leverages an algorithmic mapping which enables at the same time user-defined constraints and reuse of methods from the optimization literature. Our experiments show that the approach performs well for off-line processing and produces maps of high quality.
