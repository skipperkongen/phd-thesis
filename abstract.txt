Geographic maps are among the oldest data visualizations known to man, and their design and use has been studied for several millenia. However, the web has impacted the field of mapping in some dramatic ways.

accomodating large repositories of digital geographic information on scalable web maps is challenging for a number of reasons: (1), (2), and (3).

To address the challenges of efficient point map design, scalable map processing, and scalable map distribution, this thesis proposes novel techniques in the area of database-supported maps: (a) Glossy SQL is a concise declarative language that allows map designers to efficiently specify holistic multi-scale selection of geographic information for maps. The language supports biased random sampling of data subject to two types of user-defined constraints as well as custom objectives. The purpose of the language is to derive a target multi-scale database from a source database according to holistic specifications; (b) The Glossy SQL compiler allows Glossy SQL to be scalably executed by a spatial analytics system, such as a spatial relational database system. Scalable execution is achieved by translating Glossy SQL queries into pure relational algebra queries that can run natively in SQL-based spatial analytics systems. The implementation developed during this thesis supports the PostgreSQL dialect of SQL; (c) TileHeat is a framework and basic algorithm for partial materialization of hot tile sets for scalable map distribution. The framework predicts future map workloads based on an access log of recent requests.
