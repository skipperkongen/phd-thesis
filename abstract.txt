Geographic maps are among the oldest and most important data visualizations known to mankind. Consequently, their design and use has been studied for several millenia and are thoroughly understood. However, the web has impacted the field of mapping in three dramatic ways: (1), the typical map making professional has changed from a GIS specialist to a busy person with map making as a secondary skill. Today, maps are produced by journalists, aid workers, amateur data enthusiasts, and scientists alike. Therefore it is crucial that this diverse group of map makers is provided with expressible map design tools that time-efficiently support customized selection of data for maps; (2), The web provides access to massive data volumes and is itself a cause of prolific data creation. This calls for scalable map processing techniques that can handle the volume and which play well with the predominant data models on the web; (3), maps are now consumed around the clock by a global audience. While maps in the past should concurrently accomodate audience sizes ranging from a single person to a few people, maps today must accomodate millions of people who consume maps anywhere and anytime.

To address the challenges of efficient point map design, scalable map processing, and scalable map distribution, this thesis proposes novel techniques in the area of database-supported maps: (a) Glossy SQL is a concise declarative language that allows map designers to efficiently specify holistic multi-scale selection of geographic information for maps. The language supports biased random sampling of data subject to two types of user-defined constraints as well as custom objectives. The purpose of the language is to derive a target multi-scale database from a source database according to holistic specifications; (b) The Glossy SQL compiler allows Glossy SQL to be scalably executed in a spatial analytics system, such as a spatial relational database system. This technique allows unprecedented data volumes to be processed for maps. Scalable execution is achieved by translating Glossy SQL queries into pure relational algebra queries that can run natively in SQL-based spatial analytics systems. The implementation developed during this thesis supports the PostgreSQL dialect of SQL; (c) TileHeat is a framework and basic algorithm for partial materialization of hot tile sets for scalable map distribution. The framework predicts future map workloads based on an access log of recent requests. 

The work in this dissertation shows that Glossy SQL can consisely express a large number of important data visualization use cases. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the Glossy compiler can translate specifications of holistic selection into scalable database queries. Finally, the results show how TileHeat accurately predicts map workloads and that partial materialization of a hot set can be finished during low-intensity periods of the map distribution cycle.
