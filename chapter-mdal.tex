\chapter{Declarative Multi-scale Graph Abstraction}

We want to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Model all data as graphs, because graphs are general (they subsume spatial, temporal and social data). 
\item Analyze graphs using zoomable graph visualizations
\item Share visualizations with the world
\item Support declarative languages for creating zoomable graph visualizations
\end{itemize}

We assume that:

\begin{itemize}
\item There exists methods for transforming data into graph form
\item There exists methods for embedding graphs in the plane, i.e. cast nodes into two-dimensional points and edges into two-dimensional linestrings. 
\end{itemize}

For this to work, we must:
\begin{itemize}
\item Define projections for translating between topological graphs and plane-embedded graphs, i.e. graph layout algorithms
\item Formulate a scale-based \emph{view model} for graphs

\item Define valid transformation functions for turning one graph into another graph
\item Formulate constraints that can be evaluated over graph views
\item Define metrics for scale-based graph views, e.g. information density metrics
\item Define a distance function 
\item Define an equivalence relation between graph views at different scales, i.e. what are the constraints that must hold when transforming graphs between scales

\item Define metrics for evaluating scale-based views for graphs, e.g. density metric


We need to guide the abstraction process, i.e. objective functions. 

We want the multi-scale data abstraction of graphs to be user-programmable, to support data enthusiasts and professional analysis. We need scalable algorithms and systems that implement the whole deal.

\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}

\section{Multi-scale Graph Abstraction}
We want to compute a multi-scale data abstraction for a graph. at a set of discrete scales. For this we need to: Model data (i.e. spatial, temporal, social data) as graphs. Define a scale-based view of graphs (projection of graph into metric space, representation of metric space in pixel space). Define equivalence classes for graphs (subject to constraints)
